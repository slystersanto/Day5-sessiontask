//Write a JavaScript function to generate an array between two integers of 1 step length.

//Input :console.log(range(3, 7));
//Expected Output:[3,4, 5, 6, 7]

//stating the array start && end because the value starts from ranges
function range(start, end) {
//as we discussed in previous session we should create [] to get multiple values or needed value.
  var temp= [];
//for loop method is used to loop all the integers one by one  
  for (var i = start; i <= end; i += 1) {
    temp.push(i);
  }
//check all the conditions whether it is correct nor false it forwards to output  
  return temp;
